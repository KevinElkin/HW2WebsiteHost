      <p><center>This website is intended for providing a detailed description of how McDonalds was affected by the release of the Impossible Burger 
            by Burger King. In October 2018, our competitor Burger King released a new veggie burger known as the Impossible Burger. In order to gain insight and a clear understanding of how McDonalds has and will be affected by this new product, I have created this website to highlights macro, micro, and <BR>regional trends from January 2016 to September 2019. 
         </center></p>

      
         <h3><center>Data Sets Description</center></h3>
         <p><center>When conducting my analysis, I used 2 specific data sets supplied by the engineering team. The first data set contained monthly sales data for each menu item from January 2016 to September 2019. The data was divided into 
               several regions as follows: NE - North East, NW - North West, SE - South East, SW - South West, and C - Central. In addition to this, the data set also contained menu items as follows: HM - Hamburger, CF - Chicken fillet, and 
               FF - Fish fillet. The second data set was representative of the daily sales for the month of January 2016; this data set also followed the same sales conventions and features as the first data set listed above. 
             </center></p>
   
        
        <h4><center>Total by Region and Region Market Share</center></h4>
        <center><p>We will first start by analyzing the total sales from January 2016 to September 2019 by region. As shown in the graph below, the different regions all follow a very similar trend with one another. In other words, if the sales of one region dip or 
            increase drastically, then the other regions are likely to follow. The data also shows that all the regions dipped drastically on the month of the release of the Impossible Burger (October 2018). To further model this point, a pie graph was constructed 
            showing the percentage of sales in the last 1.5 years that come from each regain. The pie graph bellow shows that the sales from each region are roughly equal and account for approximately 1/5th (or 20%) of McDonalds sales in the United States. Both these 
               two figures allowed us to see that the amount of sales per region is roughly equal across all regions as well as the trend each region follows (i.e. if sales increase or decrease in one region it is likely to do the same in all other regions). 
            </p></center>

         <h4><center>Perecent Change Between Quarters</center></h4>
         <p><center>Combining all the sales across all regions allows us to get a more accurate picture of the total sales McDonalds has in the United States. The graph bellow shows the percent change between each quarter of the total sales McDonalds 
               has in the United States. In Q4-2018 we can see the biggest change in the total sales of McDonalds - there is a -12.25% decrease and the Impossible Burger from Burger King was released in the beginning of Q4. 
               The drastic percent change in Q4-2018 is likely due to some external factor that requires further investigation. Examining previous percent changes in Q4 shows that previous changes were not as drastic. 
               In Q4-2016 there was a 0.83% increase and in Q4-2017 there was a 2.79% increase in sales. Thus, we can see that a drastic percent change in sales in Q4 is not historically normal. We will examine our sale by item next 
               to see if there are any specific items that are/are not selling adequately at McDonalds. </p></center>

         <h4><center>Sales Distribution by Menu Item</center></h4>
         <p><center>
               The pie chart below shows how McDonalds sales were distributed from January 2016 - September 2019. As shown, McDonalds hamburgers account for 60.02% of our total sales while the chicken fillet and fish 
                           fillet account for 24.97% and 15.01% respectively. This allows us to gain greater insight as to what menu items effect our total sales the least and most. Since Burger King released a new burger to compete with 
                           our McDonalds hamburger we must investigate specifically the hamburger sales right around the range of the release of the impossible burger. Additionally, it makes sense to examine the sales of our hamburger with directly 
                           competes with Burger Kings new hamburger. </center></p>

         <h4><center>Sales and Percent Change of Menu Item per Month</center></h4>
         <p><center>The following graph shows the sales of each menu item by month from January 2016 - September 2019. After examining the sales of each item, we can calculate the percent change of each menu items total sales. We can see that the percent change for 
               the total amount of hamburgers sold between Oct 2018 - Sep 2018 decreased by 14.41%, the total amount of chicken fillets sold between Oct 2018 - Sep 2018 decreased by 13.98%, and the total amount 
               of fish fillets sold between Oct 2018 - Sep 2018 decreased by 13.34%. Thus, it is conclusive that all menu item sales were affected negatively by the release of the impossible burger (almost) equally. </center></p>

         <h4><center>Average Proportion of Menu Items sold per day for Jan 16</center></h4>
         <center><p>Lastly, we will look at daily data to see if customers prefer purchasing a certain item compared to another day of the week. The chart below showswhat proportion of items make up our total sales for a day. The data shown is for the month of 
               January 2016; the categories are separated by day of the week to allow us to gain insight and see if a particular menu item does better or worse on a certain day of the week. For the most part, the items on the menu don't see much variation in the rate 
               which they are purchased based on the weekday of January 2016. The chicken fillet was the most consistent and accounted for approximately 25%-26% of sales for all days of the week (see graph for exact breakdown). The fish fillet was most popular on Friday 
               accounting for 16.99% of total sales for the day and was least popular on Saturday and Sunday accounting for 13.6% and 13.58% of total sales respectively. The hamburger was slightly more popular on Saturday accounting for 61.28% of sales (up from Friday which 
               it accounted for 58.57% of total sales) </p></center>

         <h4><center>Conclusion and Recommendations</center></h4>
         <center><p>After analyzing the data of McDonalds sales extensively, I have drawn the following conclusions. McDonalds has been affected by the release of our competitors 
               (Burger King) new Impossible Burger negatively. It is clear that the total sales during Q4 (more specifically October 2018) have sharply decreased. Additionally, it is not just
               our burger sakes that have decreased but also our fish and chicken fillet items. At this point, it is unclear if customers just wanted to try the new Impossible Burger once because of the 
               excitement behind a new product release but it is clear that we must act fast if we wish to regain our lost share of the fast food market. I would recommend releasing a veggie burger of our own 
               as our menu only has 3 items - all of which are not plant based and/or vegan. It McDonalds wishes to attract vegetarian and vegan customers we must release a vegie burger.
